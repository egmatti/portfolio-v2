      <h4 class="project-section-title">An app that lacked the necessary<br/>features to be competitive</h4>
      <p>After spending its first four years watching competitors with more specialized or comprehensive tools win deals against it, my former company UserIQ was ready to move away from its longtime strategy of building a wide range of basic feature sets for both the product management and customer success markets and instead focus solely on satisfying the needs of customer success professionals who had been our best customers to date.</p>
      <p>The only issue is that our app didn’t meet the requirements of a CS director shopping for an all-in-one solution. Our company knew from experience that CS directors were primarily looking for a tool that would allow them to standardize the process by which their CS teams responded to different situations with their customers. Other CS platforms had this kind of functionality in the form of “playbooks,” which would assign a common set of tasks to a customer success manager when certain conditions were met for one of his or her accounts. Based on our leadership team’s directive to pivot the product and company more towards a customer success focus, however, our Director of User Experience, JD Uchima, decided that he and I needed to design our own version of this table stakes feature as well as the accompanying task management feature in order for our company to become more competitive.</p>

      <p>Playbooks had been coming up in our UX team’s Crazy 8 ideation sessions in some form or another for over a year by the time JD decided we needed to focus on designing our own version of them. They weren’t a new concept to us when we kicked off our discussions about them for this reason, but they were an ill-defined one with lots of constituent parts. Because we had limited development resources and wanted to put together a version of playbooks, tasks, and some other new CS features quickly, JD and I decided we would aim to design the simplest versions of the playbooks and tasks features and that we would split the work of designing them with him primarily working on the playbooks feature and me primarily working on the tasks one.</p>

      <p>After hearing from our leadership team that they wanted us to prioritize another feature for the time being, we had to put the playbooks and tasks plans on hold for a two-to-three month period though, which unfortunately kept getting extended because of customer commitments and the release of a new React front-end.</p>

      <p>Once these other projects were finished half a year later, JD and I decided it was time for us to pick our playbooks and tasks designs back up with a focus on task management since we thought it would be one of the next things slated for development. With a more mature understanding of how CS professionals utilize playbooks and tasks, I began to think of new ways to structure the task management feature that we were trying to add. I was particularly interested in the relationship between playbooks and tasks since they were supposed to work together with playbooks “firing off” tasks when a playbook’s conditions were met and with the tasks that a playbook “fired off” all having the account and the reason for which they were fired off in common.</p>
      <p>I put together a new set of wireframes that were similar enough to the old ones, but that had an alternate view where users could switch from seeing individual tasks in cards to seeing tasks grouped into cards by the playbook that triggered them.</p>

    </figure>
    <div class="project-subsection-text">
      <p>I liked this new concept because it gave users the opportunity to look at related tasks for the same account side-by-side and because it aligned task completion more closely to crisis management, which was first and foremost what we were designing tasks and playbooks to be used for.</p>
      <p>JD seemed to like the new concept as well but had some concerns about the sorting and filtering patterns in both the task management concepts I had worked on. We met to talk about these and other concerns and began listing out the sorting and filtering details for three distinct approaches to the task management project, the third of which was essentially a list version of the concept I had just put together.</p>

    <div class="project-subsection-text">
      <p>Later, JD created wireframes for another task management concept that was based on the first approach but that drew inspiration from the collapsing cards I had used in the playbooks view of my newer task management concept. We both agreed that his concept, which grouped tasks into cards based on their due date, was an improvement over my two earlier concepts so JD continued to hash out the details of the design, creating mockups and a prototype that demonstrated the microinteractions a user would experience when deleting a task or marking it as done.</p>

      <p>While finishing our designs for the tasks feature, we began working on new designs for the playbooks feature as well. I started things off by creating wireframes for the Create Playbook flow that were similar to the Create Event Notification flow, our app’s alert feature that would notify users when a change occurred with a particular group of users they were monitoring. My understanding of the two features was that they were essentially the same, but that playbooks had the added benefit of assigning a set of tasks to a particular UserIQ user when one of these alerts sounded. I thought I might be able to improve the way users select the group they would like to monitor and the conditions that would cause the alert to sound for both flows if I reframed the series of inputs our users had to complete into a natural language form.</p>

    <div class="project-subsection-text">
      <p>As JD pointed out to me later, even though it was possible for us to design the playbooks feature in a way that made it similar to our event notifications feature, we had the opportunity to explore other ways of approaching it. Nevertheless, he liked the natural language form pattern I had been exploring and decided to adopt it in a new concept he was creating that encompassed both the Create Playbook flow and the Playbooks list view within our app.</p>
      <p>It was around this time that I began to really think about and question what exactly a playbook was and how they would fit into our CS customers’ workflows. We had been thinking that users would create playbooks for a wide range of groups and scenarios and therefore needed the ability to combine “targets” (the groups) and “triggers” (the scenarios and conditions) whichever way they pleased. JD and I had both wondered though if our customers would all wind up creating more or less the same playbooks for their organizations—ones for onboarding, adoption, renewal, and risk. He was interested in providing users with playbook “templates” that they could use to easily get a few basic playbooks up and running for their organization while I was interested in possibly providing users with a set of alerts that could be turned off and on for each of our users’ accounts and that could be customized so that they assigned a slightly different set of tasks to a user or users when that alert sounded.</p>

    </figure>
    <div class="project-subsection-text">
      <p>It was obvious that our ideas had gone in two very different directions, which was good because it meant we were thoroughly exploring the possible solutions, but it also meant that it was time for the two of us to converge our thinkings. As JD illustrated in a diagram he created to show the different concept models we were using to solve the problem, he was thinking about playbooks as a separate feature in our app from accounts, but on an equal scale as accounts. The two overlapped when a UserIQ user or “team member” set an account as the target of a playbook, but that was it. I, on the other hand, was thinking about playbooks as a feature that lived inside an account and applied to that account only. </p>

      <p>We talked at length about the two concept models and what the most useful and also most scalable solution would be for our users. I started to think about ways of combining the ideas from his latest concept with my own as I began to see the value in his solution more and more. Whenever I compared my new, hybrid ideas with the concept he was proposing though, it was evident that his concept was still better.</p>
      <p>After spending many weeks working on the playbook designs in a relay race fashion with one of us coming up with an idea and then passing it on to the other who would then come up with a new idea based on it, we both agreed that we were satisfied with the solution JD was proposing. Because of more development setbacks, however, the project was put on hold again and we never made it to the final stages of visual design and user testing.</p>

      <h4 class="project-section-title">A new feature set that may have benefited<br/>from a more accurate product timeline</h4>
      <p>While we were unable to finish the playbook designs we had spent so much time talking about and ideating on, we left the tasks designs in a good place with mockups and a prototype that were ready for development whenever the engineering team had the resources to work on them again.</p>
      <p>Although we believed that we could create a playbooks feature that was just as good as the tasks one we had designed from the final round of wireframes JD had put together, I wonder whether we could have created an even better playbooks and tasks feature set if we had a more accurate sense of the amount of time we had to work on the project. The underlying assumption was that we needed to create a version of these features as quickly as possible, but the reality is that we had half a year or more to conduct research, iterate on our designs, and perform user tests. With a more realistic timeline and an engineering team that wasn’t single-threaded, I have no doubt that we could have created a playbooks and tasks feature set that could have propelled our company’s growth within the customer success industry that needed it.</p>
